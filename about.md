Hi 👋 , I'm Hugo Chou, also known by my Chinese name, 周昌权.

My passion extends beyond coding, as I've collaborated with a variety of businesses, from startups to e-commerce companies, agencies, and consulting firms.

I take pride in leading software projects, mentoring, and hiring software engineers to build effective teams.

In my free time, I enjoy writing blog posts about learning, development, and traveling.
